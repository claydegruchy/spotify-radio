This is a gui for the spotify radio, which will attempt to also involve the advert system

build a gui
load the current tracks and playlist from spotify
make a list of these tracks
have a section to include adverts or voice clips
drag and drop the ordering
every time a song changes, check to see if the local playlist has an advert. 
	if so, pause playback, then play the ad locally via the radio filter
	if not, keep it playing for the next track
